# Minesweeper
 Originally developed between 14th and 16th April 2019.\
 A simple minesweeper game made using tkinter in Python 3.\
 Latest version is v14\
 Need to fix:
 1. When user clears all spaces that aren't mines, win state does not come up.
 2. Dynamic sizing, i.e. not hard code pixel sizes (largest is too large for many monitors)
